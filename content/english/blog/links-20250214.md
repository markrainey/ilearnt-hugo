The links today are about developing code without thinking, interesting network projects and extensive travel tips. 

__[You should write "without bugs"](https://korshakov.com/posts/no-bugs)__

Some of the best developers I have worked with have had the ability to develop extremely quickly and also with very few bugs. It becomes a mindset of delivery whilst also developing the best code possible. These developers are very rare and I have been fortunate enough to cross paths with a couple of them.

Some really interesting networking projects that I need to look at in more detail to understand how they achieve some of the things they do.


__[The Technium: 50 Years of Travel Tips](https://kk.org/thetechnium/50-years-of-travel-tips/)__

A really great read about ways to experience better travel. Very well written and well worth a read, even if you only pick up one thing.
