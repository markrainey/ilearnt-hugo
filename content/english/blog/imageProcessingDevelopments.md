There are some amazing things happening with image processing at the moment. I remember my graphics class at university 25 years ago and the primitive, by comparison to now, image processing algorithms we had to code. Oh how things have moved on.

The first link below is some incredible work to make very low light images intelligible. The example results are quite incredible - making a viewable image out of an image that looks completely dark.

The second link shows a technique for adding new items to images in the style of the original image. Again the examples are pretty impressive - and this includes the source code.
