I have tried to avoid writing about AI as everyone seems to be doing it however I have found one site that is pretty usable and actually seems to work quite well.


[perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai/) is billed as an AI search engine where you can ask it questions in plain English and it will then offer options for further questions based on the answer given.

I've used it to look at potential places to visit in Croatia and which university my daughter should consider choosing for a psychology degree.

The answers aren't perfect by any means but I do like the way it proposes follow up questions to drill into more detail or take the session in different directions.

Is it a game changer? I don't think so but it is another tool that might be useful for some tasks.
