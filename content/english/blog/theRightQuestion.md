I've written a lot about questions, and answers.


In the book [Questions are the answer](https://amzn.to/46nWCWb) there is a quote from Peter Drucker:

> The important and difficult job is never to find the right answers,” he wrote. “It is to find the right question. For there are few things as useless—if not dangerous—as the right answer to the wrong question.

It's a bit like navigation. Your distance of travel is useless if you are heading in the wrong direction. The further you go, the harder it is to correct.
