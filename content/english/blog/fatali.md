In the 1990s I went on a walking holiday to the west coast of America and came across the photographs of [Michael Fatali](https://fatali.com/).

It was a group walking holiday with Explore where you know no-one else on the trip. The itinerary started in San Francisco and then took in a number of National Parks - Yosemite, Death Valley, Bryce, Zion, Joshua Tree, Grand Canyon and a few others - before ending up in Los Angeles. It was a brilliant trip and the walking was incredible.

About half way through the trip we did an amazing trek up a river in Zion Canyon and then went for a meal in the evening. After the meal we had a chance to wander around the town and came across the gallery of the photographer Michael Fatali.

The pictures you see on-line of his photographs do not do justice to the colours of the originals up close. He used an approach called Cibachrome, which is no longer available, and the results it can produce are amazing and way more impressive than prints using the technologies available today.

Unfortunately I was not rich enough then to afford one but it is on my bucket list to purchase one one day. 

They do come up sometimes on eBay but are usually located in the US and still out of my price range. Also the cheaper prints that come up are not the same as the full size Cibachrome ones.

He is now a bit of a controversial figure as he was found to have damage some rocks in a National Park for one of his photographs.

It would still be nice to own one one day.
