Today includes a review of the book "The Goal", how complicated a calculator app really is and an illustration using a washing machine of how the unexpected can throw a spanner in any estimates.

__[Book Review: The Goal - by Traverse Clayton](https://www.elastictier.com/p/book-review-the-goal)__

A nice balanced review of a great book to read about identifying the bottlenecks in a system. It is focussed on manufacturing but can be applied to other areas. It is an entertaining read, despite the subject matter. I've read it a couple of times and given away a copy.


__[Calculator App](https://chadnauseam.com/coding/random/calculator-app)__

Who would have thought it was so difficult to get a calculator app correct - something that is often set as a beginners learning to code task.


__[My Washing Machine Refreshed My Thinking on Software Effort Estimation](https://www.cosive.com/blog/my-washing-machine-refreshed-my-thinking-on-software-effort-estimation)__

A brilliant example of how supposedly simple tasks can take way longer than expected. Something that may sound like it is easy to do can have unexpected challenges.
