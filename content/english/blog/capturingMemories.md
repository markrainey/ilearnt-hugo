A PhD student has created a way to capture conversations with hospice patients that their relatives can play back and listen to at any time later.


It dawned on me a while ago that a lot of knowledge and memories "disappear" when someone passes away. There will be stories and information that will no longer be heard or available - people often say I wish I had asked someone about something specific. With this in mind, I recorded some of my dad's stories about him growing up and I plan to do more of this and also capture some of my mum's stories. I have also written up a lot of the details from my life - just so they are captured.

The student, Isaac Gibson, has created a way to record these conversations and then developed what he calls a "memory box" to allow the playback of each of these personal recordings. I love this idea and the video in the link is well worth a watch!
