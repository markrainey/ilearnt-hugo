The impact two orders of magnitude can have on what is needed to accomplish a task and a new type of clock designed to be the basis of an approach that is more attack resistant than the existing GPS infrastructure.


##### [Your Next Two Zeroes](https://taylor.town/next-two-zeroes)

As you add orders of magnitude the complexity, variables and skills involved in dealing with it increases dramatically. It includes some very nice examples of this happening.

The development of more accurate clocks and in turn protect against risks such as GPS jamming. 

> The potential cost of losing GPS has been put at £1.4bn each day – no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats.


It is following a similar path to the invention of the portable marine clock by John Harrison and could also have a significant impact.
