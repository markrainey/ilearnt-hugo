The type of motivation you use can make a big difference on whether you will achieve your results.

When it comes to motivation, we often debate what truly drives us: the "joy of the journey" or the promise of a reward. Understanding the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation can change how you approach your goals.

**Intrinsic Motivation**

Intrinsic motivation comes from within; it’s when you do something because it is interesting or enjoyable. As the activity is its own reward, this type of drive is essential for long-term aims. Focusing on "joy at each step" rather than just the destination makes your efforts more sustainable over time.

Examples might include changing career or learning for personal growth. These require much more effort and so lean on intrinsic motivation as you will need to buy into the actions.

**Extrinsic Motivation**

Extrinsic motivation is driven by external factors like earning a reward or avoiding a punishment. While effective for short-term tasks, it often lacks the long-term "soul" of intrinsic drive. Performance reviews, for example, often set "artificial goals" just to satisfy a corporate requirement, making them feel like box-ticking exercises.

Examples might include working to a deadline or the crowd encouraging you to win a race. These are short term motivations.

Knowing whether a goal or action is short or long term should help indicate what motivation is best suited to helping achieve it.
