Last year I took an excellent mobile photography [course](https://classbento.co.uk/smartphone-photography-class-london-bridge-0) in London.

The course was booked through ClassBento and took place on a sunny afternoon. We met up at the Hay's Galleria and then proceeded to walk along the South bank of the Thames for the next couple of hours as far as St Saviours Dock Footbridge.

Along the way we stopped at a number of points to learn techniques to improve our smartphone photography.

The key takeaways for me were to look for the unusual, use reflections and don't be afraid to alter the angle that the photograph is taken.

The tutor, Jet, was excellent and spent time explaining everything and showing how to achieve them on each of the different phone types. 

I would thoroughly recommend the course.
