I am currently starting to learn Scala (to add to a myriad of other languages I have programmed in over my career). We are also in the process of "dockerizing" our application. So I wanted to try for myself getting a simple Scala application running in Docker.

This page has a very simple guide to getting a "Hello World" application up and running.
