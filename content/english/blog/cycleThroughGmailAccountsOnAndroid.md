Using Gmail on Android it is possible to support multiple email accounts. The normal way you can change which account you are looking at is by pressing on the account picture in the top right hand corner and then selecting the user.

However I found a potentially quicker approach completely by accident. If you press on the picture as before then drag down you can cycle through the email accounts one by one.
