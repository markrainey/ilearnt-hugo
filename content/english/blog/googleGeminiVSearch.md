I rarely use Google Search now.

In the past it was a cornerstone of my Internet usage. Like most people I would go to Google and type a search term, browse the results, skipping the ads, and then click on the link that looked the most promising.

Over the past few weeks I have been leaning more and more on Google Gemini and less on Google Search. 

If I want to find out something I now just type it as a question in Gemini. There is no longer a need to try and think about what the search term looks like then scroll through a list of results trying to find the one with the information I want. I can get the answer immediately and if the answer isn't quite right I can now drill down by asking additional questions or follow the suggestions of Gemini.

When I do use Google Search I often just lean on the AI overview.

*Is it perfect?* No

*Will it get better?* Yes

*Do I still need Search?* Sometimes

This opens up very interesting questions about the future of Google as a company. According to Gemini (obviously) about 55% of Google's revenue came from paid search in Q3 2025. Even if Gemini has not got this completely correct it is probably in the right ballpark. 

- What happens to that revenue stream as more and more people switch to using Gemini? 
- What happens to Google's costs as the use of AI increases?
- What happens to advertisers if search is no longer the main place people go and people are not pointed to their information but instead rely on information in the AI models?

I think Google are in a very strong position to thrive in the new AI world due to the data they have access to and the models they have created. However there is still that underlying question of how can they monetize it enough to make it profitable and support the potential loss of revenue from search.
