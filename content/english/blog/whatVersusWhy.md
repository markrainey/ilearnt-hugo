It is very easy to resort to asking "*Why?*" when it maybe better to ask "*What?*"

In this [article](https://bartwullems.blogspot.com/2026/01/the-power-of-what-over-why.html), "*The power of 'What' over 'Why'*", it highlights that the careful choice of words when asking questions can make a big difference. 

When something goes wrong it is easy to resort to asking "*Why did it happen?*" or "*Why didn't you do ...?*". The problem with "*Why?*" questions is that the brain hears them as a judgement with all the negative connotations of that. The person on the other end is more likely to become defensive

If you flip the question around to use "*What?*" then it becomes a question of curiosity. The examples they give are: 

- **"Why did this fail?"** try **"What happened here?"**
- **"Why didn't you meet the deadline?"** becomes **"What got in the way?"**
- **"Why do you think that?"** transforms into **"What's making you think that?"**

The change is subtle but the impact on the receiver can be significant. I don't find this comes naturally for me but it starts with recognising opportunities to make this change.
