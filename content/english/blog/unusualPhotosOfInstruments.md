I recently did a photography course in London where one of the main learnings was how you can make photographs more interesting by using unusual angles and reflections.

This [article](https://www.dpreview.com/photography/5400934096/probe-lenses-and-focus-stacking-the-secrets-to-incredible-photos-taken-inside-instruments) goes a step, in fact a whole set of steps, further and involves using lots of photos to build up an image of the view inside different musical instruments. Some of them have taken up to 1000 shots to compose the single image.  

The effect is incredible with some of them looking like large halls or rooms.
