What tools are missing from *your* toolbox?

In an interview for the High Performance Podcast the comedian Sara Pascoe is asked how she copes with the pressure of making lots of people laugh every night.

She says:

> If I go out and have a bad show somewhere I don't come home saying I am a bad comedian. I go, I am person who now has a toolbox and I still didn't have what I needed tonight.

I think this is a brilliant way of looking at things. We will come across stuff where we fail or do badly, we can't be an expert in everything. All we can do is our best and if we fall short then it helps identify a gap in our toolbox - something we can work on to fill in future.

I know I have some missing tools and I am now working on addressing the ones I know about. It will take time and it won't be perfect but I will be better prepared and better equipped for next time. 

And going forward I will continue to have missing tools - and that is part of the fun of life.
