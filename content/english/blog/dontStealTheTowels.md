I recently stayed at a hotel and a small sticker in the bathroom caught my attention.


<img src="/blog/Towels.png" title="Towels Sticker" class="mid-image"><p>

It reads: 
> Our towels are available for purchase
> If you would like to purchase a towel they are available to buy from our reception team for £20.00.
> If you choose to take them from the room we will charge your account accordingly.

I view this as a nice polite way of saying don't steal our towels and if you do then you will be charged £20 for each one.
