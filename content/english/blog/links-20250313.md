A free handbook for startup CTOs and a game that involves you identifying a time and a place.

##### [Startup CTO Handbook](https://github.com/ZachGoldberg/Startup-CTO-Handbook/blob/main/StartupCTOHandbook.md)

I have not read this yet but one for me to save for the future. Just looking at the headings it looks like I should be able to pick and choose certain sections when needed.


##### [Time Portal](https://www.eggnog.ai/entertimeportal)

If you have tried Geoguessr then this is the next level. This is placing a location and time in history - really cool (and difficult). Although some of the images are not "accurate" it is still a fun exercise.
