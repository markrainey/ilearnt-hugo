Finding a good available domain name for a project, product or company is hard but there is one web tool that I have found is more successful than others.

I registered the "ilearnt.com" domain over 18 years ago. Trying to find a good short domain with the valuable ".com" extension is now much harder and potentially more expensive.

Over the years, like many technical people, I have registered a few domains for pet projects. I have tried lots of tools to find a suitable name that is available.

For a while the best tool I could find for trying lots of combinations was [Dot-o-mator](https://dotomator.com). This allowed me to try various combinations of words and prefixes/endings to try and find one that was not taken.

Recently I have been using a different tool which requires less effort and seems to be generating a really good set of results. The site is [Namelix](https://namelix.com/).

I'll work through an example to give an idea of the sort of results you can get. We will pretend we are creating a new job site - a job site for the restaurant industry.

So on Namelix we enter the keywords "jobs restaurant".

You can tweak the type of names it will generate however we will leave it on "Auto" so we benefit from all the styles. You can adjust how random the names are and also add additional brand info. For this I will leave it at "Medium" randomness. I will also skip adding a description.

Clicking "Generate" will produce a selection of names. The ones we are interested in have a green check-mark in the top right hand corner as they are the ones with available ".com" domains.

Just from a simple search, some of the names it generated included:

- WaiterWork
- GastronomicJobs
- TastyEmploy
- EatNowHire
- PlaceForTalent
- HungryHired
- DineHired
- FoodieHire
- And a whole bunch more

Are they perfect? Probably not. 

However in a couple of minutes I have a whole bunch of potential names that I could either register or use as a starting point for generating other ideas.
