Sometimes you come across a website that is simple and just works.

I’m a big fan of things that are well-designed and don’t try to be too clever. [Read Something Wonderful](https://readsomethingwonderful.com/) is a perfect example of this. 

It is a curated list of articles that are thoughtful and well-written, the kind of pieces that are likely to make you stop and think for a moment.

The subject matter is incredibly varied, and the presentation is clean, easy to navigate, and gets out of the way to let the content shine. Every time you load or refresh the site, it starts you off with a different article.

It reminds me a bit of the early web or the Google "I'm Feeling Lucky" button, where discovery felt a bit more driven by chance. In a world where we are often overwhelmed by noise, having a trusted source curate the "wonderful" things is a nice change.

Now I just need to make time to read some of them.
