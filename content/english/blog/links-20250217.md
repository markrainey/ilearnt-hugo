A wide variety today covering strong opinions, idea and growth mazes and getting sofas around corners.


##### [Dealing with strong opinions](https://www.cultivatedmanagement.com/dealing-with-strong-opinions/)

Some great advice for dealing with the situation where someone has a strong opinion and it is not the same as yours. I particularly liked "Other ways of working, work." - it is easy to forget there may be other ways of doing things that will still work but are not the same as your way of thinking.


##### [The Growth Maze vs The Idea Maze](https://andrewchen.substack.com/p/the-growth-maze-vs-the-idea-maze)

I really like the idea of the Idea Maze as a way to look at how a new product could sit within a market and how the maze may identify new avenues to follow. It does seem like quite a challenging exercise to generate it but could be massively beneficial if you can do it.


##### [The Largest Sofa You Can Move Around a Corner](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-largest-sofa-you-can-move-around-a-corner-20250214/)

We recently had to return a bed we had ordered as it wouldn't quite fit around one of the corners on our stairs (it was about 3cm too big) so this felt particularly apt.
