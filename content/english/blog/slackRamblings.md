I used to capture all my thoughts and things I was working on in a text file at work but this approach slowly died. I use a WhatsApp chat with only me in it to capture random personal stuff at the moment. 

[This](https://stephango.com/ramblings) proposes users each creating a Slack channel where they can just capture stuff - which others can see if they want to. 

I really like this idea.
