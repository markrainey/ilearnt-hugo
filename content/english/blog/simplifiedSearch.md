This is a simple way to remove all the extraneous noise from a Google search. All you need to do is append "&udm=14" to any Google search url and it will take out the new AI summary and also the sponsored links.

If you don't want to manually add it each time you can change the way the search bar works at the top of Chrome to use it by default ...

To use this as your default search engine on Chrome, go into Settings and select "Search engine". Expand the "Manage search engines and site search" section.

Click the "Add" button next to "Site Search".

In the popup dialog, enter:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Name**: Bare Google  ... or anything you want to call it

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Shortcut**: bare  ... or anything you want to use

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**URL**: https://www.google.com/search?q=%s&udm_14

Click Add.

On the newly appeared entry, click "Make default". 

Now if you type a search term in the main address bar it will search Google and remove the extra noise. If you want to go back to normal Google search just click on the Google search engine and select "Make default".
