Health is not my area of expertise but it is something I definitely need to work on.

This [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/12/well/health-tips-experts.html?unlocked_article_code=1.DFA.Xza4.ve75cKHgB04R&smid=url-share) gives 35 health tips from experts, and they cover a real mixture of areas.

I thoroughly recommend you read the article and see which ones stand out for you. 

These are the ones I liked:

**Becky Kennedy** *Clinical psychologist*  
Her second-grade teacher taught her that when a task feels impossible, it usually just means your first step needs to be even smaller. 

**Michelle Voss** *Associate professor*  
She has started looking for "movement snacks" throughout the day which are tiny movement habits that help increase her range of motion without needing a full workout.

**Michael Breus** *Sleep specialist*  
He recommends if you find yourself awake at 3 a.m., try staying in bed and practising 4-7-8 breathing combined with counting backward from 300 by threes to slow your heart rate and calm your mind. 

**Cal Newport** *Author*  
To help shift out of professional mode, he uses a secret quirky phrase like "Schedule shutdown complete" that signals the end of his workday.

**Adam Alter** *Marketing professor*  
When you’re facing a creative block, spend five minutes intentionally coming up with your absolute worst ideas. 

**Lisa Damour** *Clinical psychologist*  
Doing simple, mindless tasks like washing dishes or walking without a phone help clear the mind and solutions to your biggest problems often appear on their own.
