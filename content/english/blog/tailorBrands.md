I came across a link on Product Hunt to [Tailor Brands](https://www.tailorbrands.com/?ref=producthunt) who do automatic logo creation and branding. It is great to see them still doing well. I used them for my company logo, [Sentio Ventures](https://sentioventures.com), shortly after they started in 2014!
