Today we have the main developer productivity killer, startups and aliens, and build time.

__[Context-switching is the main productivity killer for developers](https://newsletter.techworld-with-milan.com/p/context-switching-is-the-main-productivity)__

When I am coding I really benefit from being able to focus for long periods of time with no meetings, messages or interruptions. The article claims that every interruption that causes a context switch costs 23 minutes of productive work. That may be on the high side but there is a definite impact.


__[The Startup Drake Equation](https://longform.asmartbear.com/startup-drake-equation)__

I have been following this blog for a while. I really like how he uses the Drake equation (the likelihood of extra-terrestial life) to illustrate what needs to align for startup success. He also gives a few ideas on how to reduce the impact of some of those areas. 


__[Build Times: The Most Important Developer Productivity Metric](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/most-important-developer-productivity-metric-build-times)__

The impact of a slow build on developer productivity is often underestimated. One of my teams uses Scala and I can't believe how slow the build process is compared to other languages - and in turn how it changes their workflow.
