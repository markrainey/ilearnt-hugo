I was doing a 1:1 meeting recently and we talked about their code reviews of a recent joiner. 

When doing these reviews it is easy to just pick up the faults and issues that need correcting. I learnt from a previous team that there is a lot of value in adding positive feedback as comments for the things that have been done well. This is even more true for new joiners. 

A code review doesn't always have to be about finding fault, it can also be about finding things done well.

It links nicely to this [article](https://matthewdicks.com/why-positive-feedback-is-important/) by Matthew Dicks where he talks about an executive he was talking to who viewed positive feedback just as a compliment and not really appreciating the value it offers.

He explains that positive feedback can have multiple benefits:

> We often aren’t aware of what we do well, so by alerting you to this, I can ensure that you don’t arbitrarily extinguish the behaviour because you don’t understand its value.

> By alerting you to what you’re doing well, I can improve the frequency and consistency of that behaviour, thus improving overall performance.

So, next time you are reviewing something, try and include something positive. It can make a difference.
