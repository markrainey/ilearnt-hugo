I read a lot of books and once I start reading a book I normally finish it. This article proposes that it may be more valuable to have a bunch of books that are unread. Not sure I completely buy in to the proposition that "Read books are far less valuable than unread ones" however maybe I won't feel so guilty buying a book and then leaving it unread.
