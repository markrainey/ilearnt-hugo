We’ve all been there: debating a single word in an email or spending ages coming up with the name of a project or even a variable. We treat these choices like permanent, life-altering commitments when most are actually just *"hats."* 

Lots of people have come up with frameworks to help the decision making process but two of the better known ones are:

- James Clear’s Hat/Haircut/Tattoo analogy and
- Jeff Bezos’s One-Way versus Two-Way Door 

These two frameworks pit decisions against reversibility and permanence. James Clear breaks down a decision into how long you would have to live with the decision, hence *hat*, *haircut* or *tattoo*. Jeff Bezos breaks it down into how easy is it to reverse the decision: a *two way door* is easy, a *one way door* is either impossible or at least extremely difficult, painful and/or expensive. 

However they align really nicely:

**Hat Decisions (Two-Way Doors)**: If you don’t like the hat, you can just take it off. The reversal cost is near zero and you can decide in seconds. 

**Haircut Decisions (Two-Way Doors)**: A bad haircut is annoying and potentially embarrassing, but it grows back in weeks. It is low cost, but requires time. You can decide in hours or days. 

**Tattoo Decisions (One-Way Doors)**: Once the ink is in, it is permanent. To reverse this involves extreme pain and expense. These can/should require weeks of deliberation. 

One of the biggest productivity killers is treating a *"haircut"* like a *"tattoo."* You can change a website layout in an afternoon, but you can’t easily reverse a signed ten-year merger. High performers can move fast because they recognize that 90% of their day involves reversible *"Hat"* and *"Haircut"* choices. 

Next time you are stuck in "analysis paralysis," ask yourself:

- **How easily can I go back?** If you fail, can you return to exactly where you are now? 
- **How long will the impact be?** Will you live with the result for a day, a month, or a decade? 

**The "Rule"**: If it’s a Hat, just do it. If it’s a Haircut, set a 24-hour deadline. Save your soul-searching for the Tattoos.
