I recently came across two different websites that allow you to look at the world through photos in two completely different ways.
The first site is called **ChronoPhoto**. It displays a photograph and you have to guess when it was taken - the closer to the correct year the more points you get. You get five photos to identify.

The second site is completely different and is called the **Wonders of Street View**. It is a collection of the weirdest street view images that you can click through one at a time.
