The garage that services my car encourages people to book their services through their website.

This should be easy but due to one piece of missing information means that it requires me to call them instead.

In the old days a car had a log book for servicing and after every service a garage would write in the book and stamp it. With newer cars, like my Skoda, this has moved to digital service records.  This move may be nice for the garage but means that the customer has to know how and where to look up the service history, if it is even available.

When I book my service online it asks if it is a minor or a major service. As my last service was six months ago I have no idea so I now either need to find out how to get access to those online service records (including registering my details etc) and look it up or I can just ring the garage and ask them.

Why can't the website look this up? I get an email telling me the service is due, it is a Skoda website and could access a Skoda system. It could at least make a suggestion based on the records it has and ask me to confirm it.

Instead I end up calling the garage, which takes up mine and their time. I wonder how much time they spend answering calls like this and whether this cost would offset the development costs to fix this?
