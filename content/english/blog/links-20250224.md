A great video from Google with a nice twist, four categories of software quality and way to annoy engineers (not just senior engineers as the title says).

##### [Video: Dream Job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7e6g11BJc0)

Being a dad, I thought this ad by Google was really clever and quite moving.


##### [Software Quality](https://newsletter.getdx.com/p/software-quality-94e)

I like the way software quality has been broken down into four categories: *process quality* (like code reviews, test coverage, ...), *code quality* (maintainability, testability, ...), *system quality* (performance, security, ...) and *product quality* (user experience, ...).

I have experienced most of these at some point in my career. Hopefully I haven't done too many of them to my teams.
