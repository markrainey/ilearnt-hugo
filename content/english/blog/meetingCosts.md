We had a meeting recently with 16 people on the video conference call. Due to poor planning and technical issues it took nearly half an hour to decide to postpone the meeting. That is eight man hours wasted - a whole day of work!

This article proposes an add-on to the calendar that informs the person booking the meeting how much the meeting will effectively cost the company. Love it!

As a side note, the meeting has since been reduced to five people and is much more productive.
