A collection of links about changing a data structure, SaaS v AI Agents, chat UI for development, a developer philosophy and the Model Context Protocol.

__[Undergraduate Upends a 40-Year-Old Data Science Conjecture](https://www.quantamagazine.org/undergraduate-upends-a-40-year-old-data-science-conjecture-20250210/)__

A hash table is a fundamental data structure used everywhere. A student found a way to make it even faster and in the process throw out a number of previous conjectures. Do I understand it? No. Is it impressive? Very. There is also a video here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArQNyOU1hyE


__[What Happens to SaaS in a World with Computer Using Agents?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nWZtJlPmBD15rGqNxj7u6HroaNvXT6YD-TXktpIwf6c/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ttpp86707mip)__

An examination of how SaaS (Software as a Service) might have to change to accommodate AI agents in the future. The access to data by an agent becomes a key driver in the future.


__[Chat is a bad UI pattern for development toolsâ€”Daniel De Laney](https://danieldelaney.net/chat/)__

I've only just started to us AI when developing. I mostly use it as a "how do I do this?" question as opposed to writing large chunks of code. This article makes the premise, which I mostly agree with, that writing code requires precision when defining requirements - it is more like writing a document than have a conversation. Maybe reality is that it sits somewhere inbetween. A lot of documents are created and refined by multiple parties, a sort of conversation about changes in the document.


__[Developer philosophy](https://qntm.org/devphilo)__

A philosophy of software development. I particularly like the "Aim to be 90% done in 50% of the available time" as this is so true and definitely something to consider when estimating the amount of work involved.


__[Extending AI chat with Model Context Protocol (and why it matters)](https://interconnected.org/home/2025/02/11/mcp)__

It is worth keeping an eye on MCP and whether it becomes the de facto way for AI agents to get data.
