The links today include lessons from an angry meeting, Internet artifacts, the developer tooling industry, the length of media and a writing tip.

##### [Lessons From An Angry Uber All-Hands Meeting](https://newsletter.canopy.is/p/lessons-from-an-angry-uber-all-hands)

There are some lessons to be learned from the way Uber recently handled changes to their working practices. This is a breakdown on what could have been handled better - the same message, delivered in a different way.


##### [Internet artifacts](https://neal.fun/internet-artifacts/)

A nice tour through some of the early days of the Internet. Some of them definitely brought back memories.


##### [Developer Tooling is a Lousy Business](https://avdi.codes/developer-tooling-is-a-lousy-business/)

The article probably rightly claims that the developer tools business is a very difficult one. However there are exceptions. I worked with two people who went on to be very successful in this marketplace (Paul Stovell @ [Octopus](https://octopus.com/) and Andrew Burnett-Thompson @ [SciChart](https://www.scichart.com/)). I also know some of the sacrifices they both went through - it is definitely not an easy path.


##### [Just the right length](https://seths.blog/2025/05/just-the-right-length/)

Seth Godin explains why different types of media are the length they are and how this is slowly changing. I have regularly read books that could have easily been half the length they were to get the same message across.


##### [Say Your Writing](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SayYourWriting.html)

Both my kids are doing qualifications that involve them writing essays. The main piece of advice I gave them when reviewing their work is to read what they have written out loud. I have used this so many time to catch issues or improve my own writing.
