The IT job market is definitely going through a serious dip at the moment. Some of it may be impact of AI but there are probably other factors at play. From speaking to ex-colleagues who are currently looking for roles it seems harder now than it ever has been to find their next role.

__[No calls](https://keygen.sh/blog/no-calls/)__

An interesting approach to enterprise sales where everything is done via email rather than the traditional phone calls. One key finding was that the right people tend to be on the email threads. One of the challenges of a lot of sales calls is having everyone present who needs to be, without wasting people's time. As I am getting pulled into more meetings with potential customers I can see the benefit of this approach.
