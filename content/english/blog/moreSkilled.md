Seth Godin [asks](https://seths.blog/2025/10/on-making-it-worse/) 

> If someone with more skill and dedication took over your work, how many ways could they make it better?
 
This is an interesting way to highlight areas of weakness and areas for improvement. It can also highlight your strengths. 

**No-one is perfect** so this question should always highlight something that can be addressed or improved. 

The most obvious application of this is the work environment however it could be applied to most areas of life.
