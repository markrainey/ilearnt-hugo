I have recently been on the look out for a simple journaling/note capture application.

In the past I have kept a diary for a number of years and I still have them somewhere in the attic. 

In a lot of my jobs I kept a simple text file with all my notes grouped by the date. Two people I previously worked with commented on this recently and how I handed over a massive set of notes to them when I left. 

Recently I felt I needed something to just capture random notes and thoughts. 

I tried using iaWriter and a folder of markdown files and it sort of worked. I used to use Obsidian a lot and, similarly, that sort of worked but seemed a bit overkill. I've used a WhatsApp chat with just me in it to capture random thoughts and links. Again, it worked but it is not the easiest to search and navigate.

I have been unable to find something that is simple and I can just update easily when I want to ... until last week.

Last week I came across a nice simple app called "[Twos](https://www.twosapp.com/)".

It allows me to create a "list" with a single button press every day where I can just add random notes. I have the Windows app open all the time now and as I do things I just add a new note - it is that simple.

And that is the beauty of it - it is very quick and very simple.

It is early days and I've only used it a little bit but so far I am impressed. It has a whole bunch of other features around lists and tasks, which I am sure I will try at some point but for now I am happy with the simplicity.

All it needs now is the release of an updated Android app so I can use it natively on my phone rather than having to use the website on there.
