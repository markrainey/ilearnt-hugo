My son hit an error on his Xbox that stopped him logging in.

The error had the code "***0x80860010***" and said "***This app made too many requests. Press retry to continue***".

We checked the network, successfully logged in with a different account but it still would not log him in.

If anyone else hits this problem the solution that worked for him was:

- Go to **Settings** > **Network** > **Network settings**.
- Select **Advanced settings**, choose **Alternate MAC address**, and then select **Clear**.
- Restart your console.
