[This](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1929597620969951434) will become out of date quickly but a useful guide for which models to use for which tasks and which to avoid.

The current recommended models are:

| Model   | Usage                     |
| :------ | :------------------------ |
| GPT-4o  | *Most tasks*              |
| o3      | *Hard or important tasks* |
| GPT-4.5 | *Writing*                 |
| GPT-4.1 | *Coding*                  |
