A brilliant advert from Apple in 2013 and the need for "normal" engineers on teams.

##### [Apple innovation and execution](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2025/3/13/apple-innovation-and-execution)

I'm not a big Apple fan. I use a Windows laptop and have an Android phone. The rest of my family mostly use Apple. This article asks whether Apple have lost direction and are no longer the company they used to be. 

*However that is not why I included the link.* 

At the end of the article is a video of an ad from Apple in 2013 and it is genius and beautiful. Please watch it.


##### [Why "Normal" Engineers Are the Key to Great Teams](https://spectrum.ieee.org/10x-engineer)

This makes the case that a team needs "normal" engineers as well as the superstar engineers.

> The best engineering orgs are not the ones with the smartest, most experienced people in the world. Theyâ€™re the ones where normal software engineers can consistently make progress, deliver value to users, and move the business forward. Places where engineers can have a large impact are a magnet for top performers. Nothing makes engineers happier than building things, solving problems, and making progress.

Sometimes you need engineers to just get the work done well.
