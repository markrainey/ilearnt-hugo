A place in Japan where you can shoplift, as long as you are silent, and what does it mean to have high agency?

##### [Tokyo's Silent "Theft" Event Returns](https://www.tokyoweekender.com/japan-life/tokyos-silent-theft-event-returns/)

Imagine going to a place where you can legally shoplift - but you have to be silent ...


##### [High Agency](https://www.highagency.com/)

A long article by George Mack about the concept of "high agency". He gives a hypothetical question to identify who in your life has high agency:

> You wake up in a 3rd world jail cell. Youâ€™re only allowed to call one person you know to get you out of there. Who do you call?

He then goes further and explains that you need 3 things to demonstrate high agency:

- Disagreeability
- Clear thinking
- Bias to action

You need all three.
