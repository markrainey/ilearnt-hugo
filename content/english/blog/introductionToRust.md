Chris Woodruff produced an excellent series of posts to introduce the C# developer to the language of Rust.

At times it did have the feel of just looking for ways that Rust is better than C# but even so it was a nice read. I'm not sure it is a path I will follow as it reminded me a little of having to track pointers in the C and C++ days and I was very glad to leave all that behind.
