This article uses a really neat analogy with Tetris for illustrating the impact of technical debt. Leaving gaps is akin to leaving technical debt in the code base and makes subsequent changes more difficult or slower to ship.

> A buried gap in Tetris represents technical debt.

It also points out the fact that it is called debt and so has to be paid off at some point.

> Paying down technical debt keeps you competitive. It keeps you in the game.

I wonder what other computer games could be used for analogies.
