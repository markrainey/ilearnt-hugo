A predicted upcoming economic disruption, and it is not AI, and the battle for the thermostat that is very real in our house.

This article argues that the introduction of weight loss drugs and their impact on people's impulsiveness will have a huge impact on the economy. By reducing/eliminating impulse purchases whole sectors are going to have to rethink how they operate. I'm not sure I buy into all their arguments but I do like the way they work through the impact it could potentially have. If you tie this in to the disruption we are seeing with AI at the moment on the jobs market there are some very turbulent times ahead.

There is definitely a battle for the thermostat in our house. My wife will walk around the house in a fleece while I am sweating in a t-shirt. In our first house the thermostat was near the door. When we came back from somewhere she would walk in and turn the thermostat up and I would follow her in and nudge it down a little.
