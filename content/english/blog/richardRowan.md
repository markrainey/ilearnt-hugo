I came across the work of Richard Rowan by accident.

We were visiting my daughter at university and were wandering past a Castle Fine Art gallery. We always enjoy a quick look around galleries, even if most of the work is well out of our price range.

After having a good look round there was one set of paintings that stood out for me. The sales person approached us and gave us more details about the paintings and how they were created.

It turned out that the artist, [Richard Rowan](https://www.richardrowanart.com/), does everything backwards.

Most artists start with the background and layer the details on top. Richard does the opposite; he paints on glass from underneath, starting with the fine details and finishing with the background. The skill required for this is incredible. Given the level of detail he achieves, a single piece can take months to produce.

He explains some of the process he uses in this [video](https://youtu.be/O70Py8-cEFo?si=LuG5A99_262IQiU0).

I would love to own one of his paintings at some point.
