  title: "Welcome to ... I Learnt"
  content: |+
    I love to learn - whether it is from books, websites, videos, podcasts or people. This means I come across a lot of \"stuff\" every day that I find either interesting, enjoyable or have learnt something from.\
    \
    Regularly I will be chatting to someone and I'll suddenly remember something I came across that might be relevant or useful to them - and then you get the classic thought process of \"I read that somewhere, now where was it, I remember it was just after another article and it had an image of a tiger at the top\" etc. \
    \
    Always be curious!
